"""
Python interpreter executes a Python script from the top of the file when you run on it, or when the script
is imported as a module.

Like most other programming languages, a 'main' function defines a program starting point and is useful to
better understand the flow of a program. All the logics in the main function is executed only when run as a program
and not executed when imported as a module.
